    <h3 class="title">*Ecological Footprint</h3>
    <p>The ecological footprint shows how much land we need to produce the natural resources we consume and absorb the waste we produce.</p>

    <p>Human well-being is closely connected with the state of nature. Like all living things, human life and well-being depend on the Earth and its resources. On the other hand,  a man destroys the world on which his future and present are based. As a result, the point will soon come when global environmental crises become regular and there is less and less chance that we will be able to slow down the process before it turns into a disaster.</p>
    <p>So one of the most important tasks and challenges of humanity now would be to find a way to mitigate the damage done to the Earth.</p>
